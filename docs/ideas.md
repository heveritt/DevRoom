# Ideas

- Do managers actually want/need to understand technical implementation?
- Would developers migrate to a new software engineering paradigm?
- Do adult learners want to learn programming through a Scratch-like interface?
- Ontologies exist (Eg. Schema.org), why aren't they used in software?
- Is it necessary to make an internationally understood language when most people simply known/will learn English?
- How would you migrate an existing code base to use Franca?
- New generation of developers use AI/chatbots as their coding interface, how does Franca integrate with this?

Project Overview

The Franca project aims to create a universal programming language that is accessible to everyone, used initially for education but with the potential to be used for general purpose programming. It is designed to be:

- Easy to learn and use
- Able to reference real-world ideas and concepts
- Able to build functioning web applications in Python or JavaScript


## Goals and Objectives

### Universal Accessibility
Empower individuals to embark on their programming journey through a universally understood language that incorporates blocks, symbols, and words, making learning accessible to all.

### Real-World Integration
Leverage a comprehensive ontology that facilitates references to real-world entities, enhancing the intuitiveness and contextual relevance of programming.

### Ease of Development
Streamline the process of creating web applications by promoting the reuse of existing components and applications, thereby accelerating development.

### Open Source Collaboration
Cultivate a vibrant global community of contributors dedicated to the continuous improvement and expansion of the platform.

# Strategy

## Phase 1

Goal: Publicly available resources that we can show people who are interested in the project, and a way for them to contribute to it.

- Franca Language (Hugo)
- Franca Ontology (Hugo)
- Franca Compiler (Hugo)
- Open Source Collaboration (Chris)


## Phase 2

Goal: A working prototype for the Franca learning tool.

- Web Application Frontend (Hugo + Contributors)
- Web Application Backend (Chris)
- Cloud Services (Chris)

## Phase 3

Goal: Find funding for the non-profit organisation, more collaborators for the open source projects, and test users for the Franca learning tool.

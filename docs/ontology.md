#### **Ontology Design**
- Data Model: Define a structured data model to represent entities, concepts, relationships, and definitions.
- Domain Coverage: Include concepts from mathematics, science, medicine, engineering, finance, and more.
- Extensibility: Allow for the ontology to be expanded with new concepts and relationships over time.

#### **Data Structures**
- Entity Definitions: Provide detailed descriptions, properties, and behaviors of real-world entities.
- Relationship Mapping: Define how entities relate to each other (e.g., inheritance, composition).
- Context Awareness: Enable the system to understand the context in which entities are used.

#### **Integration with Programming Environment**
- Autocomplete and Suggestions: Offer intelligent suggestions based on the ontology when users select entities.
- Validation: Check for semantic correctness using the ontology to prevent logical errors.
- Documentation Links: Provide quick access to definitions and explanations within the ontology.
